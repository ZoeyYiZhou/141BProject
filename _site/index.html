<p>Our topic is to analysis water uses of crops in San Joaquin Valley, California. Droughts have stocked California for the past 6 years and it has been eased a little bit due to recent rain. However, the severe effect from drought is still influencing California. Last Month, NASA published a report about lands in San Joaquin Valley are sinking into the ground. Some areas sunk for more than a feet in a year. It is caused by the fact that too much ground water has been drawn from the ground and most of those water goes into agriculture.</p>

<p>In the main time, about 13% of US agriculture production came from San Joaquin Valley. It is a challenge to find the balance between reducing water uses in agriculture and keeping the production of crops going. Here we investigate the appropriate crops to grow and the trends of changing in crops areas in the past 6 years. Ideally, we want to help farmers make decisions on what to grow, and help the government to get ideas of current water usage in agriculture in San Joaquin Valley.</p>

<p><img src="Table.png" style="float: center; padding: 1em" width="90%" /></p>

<p>We had our data from 5 resources, and we merged by common features across tables. For tables that don’t have common features, we create features which can be used to merge the other tables. For example, in the Cropland Data Layer(CDL) excel, we created county name based on the locations of subbasins so that this table can be merged with Water Usage for crops by county. The highlighted feature in the table below are the common features. We also web-scrape precipitation store in API format from the Internet and manually summarized crops’ economic value from reading pdfs from the website. Here are lists of our data sources</p>

<p><img src="zPlot_Image/appropriateness.png" style="float: center; padding:0.1em" width="60%" /></p>

<p>We create a new variable ‘appropriateness’ by using Water Usage Per Acre divided by Percipitation from our dataset.Ideally, if the precipitation happens to be equal to the total water crops needed to grow, our definied ‘appropriateness’ will be one. In this case, farmers do not need to draw more water from the ground. However, usually the appropriateness will be bigger than one, as the crops in general need more water than precipitation. Here, a smaller appropriateness value indicates a higher appropriateness in growing the crop in given area.</p>

<h2 id="ready-here-are-our-analysis-results-for-each-graph-below-we-also-have-link-to-its-interactive-plot-">Ready? Here are our analysis results. For each graph below, we also have link to its interactive plot .</h2>

<p><img src="zPlot_Image/Area_Value_Precipitation_Trends.png" style="float: center; padding:0.1 em" width="90%" /></p>

<p>This is a bar plot showing the trend for crop area, precipitation and crop economic value from 2010 to 2015. We standardized the value of area, economic value and precipitation and put them into a same bar plot graph. We can see that precipitation of San Joaquin valley dropped significantly since 2011 except year 2013. The crops area trends is consistent with precipitation and the crops area reaches its minimal in 2015. This fact proves that agriculture production is severely affected by the lack of rains. In the main time, the economic value of crops reaches its maximum in 2011 and starts to drop each year afterwards, and reaches the minimal value in 2015. Overall, we can see that agriculture production is severely affected by the lack of rains, and experiences an decrease in production from economics aspect. Click <a href="zhtml/Area_Value_Precipitation_Trends.html">here</a> for the interactive plot.</p>

<p><img src="zPlot_Image/Area_Trends_For_Crops.png" style="float: center; padding:0.1em" width="90%" /></p>

<p>In this graph, we separate the crops by three tiers according to thier water usage. We rank the crops by unit water usage in 2010. Top 10% of crops in terms of water usage are named high water usage crop. Bottom 40% of crops in terms of water usage are named low water usage crops. The rest is medium water usage crops. We can see that the Area of High water usage crops have decreased dramatically since 2010. The area of low water usage crops has increased by a comparably smaller amount since 2010. Medium water usage crops kept relatively constant. It shows that farmer has been trying to grow more low water usage crops and less high water usage crops. Click <a href="zhtml/Area_Trends_For_Crops.html">here</a> for the interactive plot.</p>

<p><img src="zPlot_Image/18.png" style="float: center; padding:0.1em" width="90%" /></p>

<p>We calculate appropriateness level for all crops in all 18 subbasins, and plot their their appropriatenss in ascending order in one plot. Picture above only shows the appropriateness for crops in two subasin:Chowchilla and Madera.  Each bar represent a crop in selected subbasin. From the plot, we see that grain, tropical plant and potatoes are the top 3 water-saving crops in San-Joaquin Valley. Too see crops in other subbasin and want to compare crop appropriateness and crop across basin, click the subbasin on the legend on <a href="zhtml/2_bars.html">the interactive plot</a>, it will toggle the plot to filter by sub-basin.</p>

<p><img src="zPlot_Image/Map.png" style="float: center; padding:0.1em" width="90%" /></p>

<p>According to the water appropriateness levels, in each Subbasin, we pick the top 50% crops (approx 7 crops) in terms of best water appropriateness. Among these top water saving crops, we then rank them by production economics value, and project the top 3 economic crops for each subbasin.  According to the criteria, for example, we suggest farmer from Turlock to grow safflower, field crop, and tropical plant. Simply click on a data point(subbasin location) on this <a href="zPrj_map/SJV_basin.html">interactive map</a>, you will sse the suggested crops to grow in each subbasin in San Joaquin Valley.</p>

<p>Some crops appear more than once in the suggested crops for 18 sub-basins, whereas some crops never appear in the suggested crops section. We want analyze some of those crops to see which sub-basin can plant them.These are the crops with low price but need lots of water 
Corn Alfalfa grain trends:</p>

<p><img src="zPlot_Image/Corn_Alfalfa_Grain_Trends.png" style="float: center; padding:0.1em" width="90%" /></p>

<p>We plot the area in growing alfalfa, grain and corn to show trends. These 3 plants have high water consumption, but low economic values, and they are widely grown in San Joaquin Valley. Note that alfalfa is used for grazing, hay, and silage. In the bars for alfalfa, we can see that the area of alfalfa has dropped significantly, but the total area in growing alfalfa is still big. Similar trends happened for both grain and corn. It will be a better idea if California can import alfalfa, grain and corn, or find their substitutes to grow to save water. <a href="zhtml/Corn_Alfalfa_Grain_Trends.html">Corn_Alfalfa_Grain_Trends</a></p>

<p><img src="zPlot_Image/3mid.png" style="float: center; padding:0.1em" width="90%" /></p>

<p>These are the crops with medium price and need decent water.
Other Three Crops: We plot the trend of Potato, Melon&amp;Cucumber, and Deciduous Plant. These crops need decent water to grow, and can be sold with medium price. For potatoes, we recommend Chowchilla, Madera and Kaweah sub-basin to plant. For Melon&amp;Cucumber, we suggested Delta-Mendota, Modesto and Turlock to grow. For Deciduous Plant, we recommend Cosumnes, Eastern San Joaquim and Tracy to grow. <a href="zPlot_Image/Mid_Three_Crops.html">mid crops</a></p>
