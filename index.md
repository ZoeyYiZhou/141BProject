Our topic is to analysis water uses of crops in San Joaquin Valley, California. Drought has stocked California for the past 6 years and it has been eased a little bit due to recent rain. However, the sever effect from drought are still influencing California. Last Month, NASAS published a report about lands in San Joaquin Valley are sinking into the grouped. Some areas sunk for more than a feet in a year. It is caused by the fact that too much ground water draw from the ground and most of those water goes into agriculture.  
In the main time, about13% of US agriculture production came from San Joaquin Valley. It is a challenge to find the balance between reduces water uses in agriculture and keep the production of crops going. 
We got help from UC Davis Water and energy efficiency center and try to investigate the appropriate crops to grow and the trends of changing in crops in the past 6 years. Potentially we want to help governmentâ€™s and farmers` decision making and help them to decide the best crop to grow in terms of water usage.

## [](#header-1)Data Cleaning and Munging Before Analysis 

We had our data from 5 resources, and we merged by common features across tables. For table that doesn't have common features, we will creat feature which can be used to merge the other table. For example, in the Cropland Data Layer(CDL) excel, we created county name based on where subbasins are located, so that this table can be merged  with Water Usage for crops by county. The highlighted feature in the table below are the common feature.

## [](#header-1)Data Analysis/Visulization  

- [Apttopriateness](zhtml/Appropriateness_level.html).
- [The most Expensice crops](zhtml/MostThreeExpensive.html).
- [Area Value Precipitation Trends](zhtml/Area_Value_Precipitation_Trends.html)
  We standardized the value of area, economic value and precipitation and put them into a same bar plot graph.   In the graph of Area, Value, and precipitation trends, we can see that precipitation of San Joaquin valley dropped significantly since 2011 except year 2013.   The crops area trends is consistent with precipitation and the crops area rich it`s minimal at year 2015. This fact proves that agriculture production is severely effected by the lack of rains. 
  
  In the main time, the economic value of crops reaches it`s maximum at year 2011 and is dropping each year since 2011. Again it reaches the minimal economic value at year 2015.   Overall, we can see that agriculture production is severely effected by the lack of rains in both producing area aspect and economics aspect. 
- [Area trends for crops](zhtml/Area_trends_for_crops.html)
  In this graph, we separate the crops by three tiers according to it`s water usage. Top 10% of crops in terms of water usage are named after high water usage crop. Bottom 40% of crops in terms of water usage are called low water usage crops. The rest is called medium water usage crops.
  We can see that the Area of High water usage crops have decreased dramatically since 2010. The area of low water usage crops has increased by a comparably smaller amount since 2010. Medium water usage crops kept relatively constant. It shows that farmer has been trying to grow more low water usage crops and less high water usage crops. 
- [Alfalfa areas trends](zhtml/Alfalfa_areas_trends.html)
  We plot the trends of area that grows Alfalfa, a High water consumption plants, widely grows in San Joaquin Valley and is used for grazing, hay, and silage. It has a low economics value but very high water consumptions. In the graph of Alfalfa trends, we can see that the area of Alfalfa has dropped significantly, but are still growing in many area. 
  It will be a great idea that if California can import Alfalfa or find it`s substitute to save water.
